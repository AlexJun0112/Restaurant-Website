Hi teacher, 

We are Liew Zi Feng and Yong Yung Jun
Here are some notes for our assignment.

1. resolution - Some of the webpages are not responsive or the design got problem. 
		This is because we design in different aspect ratio of screen.
		For example: about us, login and register page is not responsive.
		*Yung Jun using 15"6' laptop, but I'm using 27"desktop 

2. Work Breakdown Structure - 	Yung Jun: Home, Product, About Us, Feedback, FAQ,Header
				Zi Feng : Login, Register, Cart, Payment, Locate Us, footer

3. Reason why the cart page was designed in that way - 
	i. 	unable to pass the data from this.js to another js file
	ii. 	unable to run the function in this.html and display the result in another html file
	iii. 	So then i need to create add to cart button and display those foods in cart page.
		Then it would be easier for me to code javascript as all the data is in the cart.html.

4. Error on cart.js 	- 	the innerText error might happen when click on the 
				"add to cart icon" in cart.html. Sometime it work properly,
				but sometime got error. Sorry about that. I cant fix it.
			-	There are two foods were added in the cart in advance manually,
				in case of the error happen again.

Last, Thank you for spending time to read this text file.
